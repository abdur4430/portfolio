I gained hands-on experience in web development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), allowing me to build dynamic and responsive web applications. I also became familiar with CRM software for business process tracking and customer management. My coursework and projects included exposure to quality assurance tools like Postman and Zest for API testing and process validation. Additionally, I explored computer vision and automation using Python, which helped me understand how to build intelligent systems. These experiences have equipped me with a versatile technical skill set and a problem-solving mindset that I continue to build on."
